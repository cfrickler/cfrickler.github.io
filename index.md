# Homer is Everyman

Everyman (Avery Mann) is a superhero created by Comic Book Guy. Homer portrays him in the film adaptation.

Everyman's real identity is a mail carrier called Avery Mann. When he turns into Everyman, he can touch a comic and receive the powers of that comic's superhero. In one issue, a bank was being robbed and, when Avery Man saw it, he hid and came back as Everyman. He then touched a comic of Iron Man and took his powers. The robbers shot him, but the bullets didn't hurt him. One robber surrendered easily, but the other tried to make a run for it, which caused Everyman to absorb the powers of Plastic Man to entrap him in a makeshift cage.
